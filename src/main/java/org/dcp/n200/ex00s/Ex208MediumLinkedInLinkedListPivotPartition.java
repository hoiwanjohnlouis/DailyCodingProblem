 This problem was asked by LinkedIn.

 Given a linked list of numbers and a pivot k, partition the linked list
 so that all nodes less than k come before nodes greater than or equal to k.

 For example,
 given the linked list 5 -> 1 -> 8 -> 0 -> 3 and k = 3,
 the solution could be 1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3.
