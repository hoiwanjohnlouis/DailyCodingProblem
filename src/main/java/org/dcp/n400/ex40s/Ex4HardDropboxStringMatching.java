/**
 This problem was asked by Dropbox.

 Implement an efficient string matching algorithm.

 That is, given a string of length N and a pattern of length k,
 write a program that searches for the pattern in the string
 with less than O(N * k) worst-case time complexity.

 If the pattern is found, return the start index of its location. If not, return False.
