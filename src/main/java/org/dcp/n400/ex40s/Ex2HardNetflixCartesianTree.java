 This problem was asked by Netflix.

 A Cartesian tree with sequence S is a binary tree defined by the following two properties:

 It is heap-ordered, so that each parent value is strictly less than that of its children.
 An in-order traversal of the tree produces nodes with values that correspond exactly to S.

 For example, given the sequence [3, 2, 6, 1, 9], the resulting Cartesian tree would be:

        1
      /   \
    2       9
   / \
  3   6

 Given a sequence S, construct the corresponding Cartesian tree.
