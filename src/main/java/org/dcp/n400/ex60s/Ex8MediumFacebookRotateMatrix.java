 This problem was asked by Facebook.

 Given an N by N matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees clockwise.

 For example, given the following matrix:

    [[1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6],
     [7, 8, 9]]

 you should return:

    [[7, 4, 1],
     [8, 5, 2],
     [9, 6, 3]]

 Follow-up: What if you couldn't use any extra space?
