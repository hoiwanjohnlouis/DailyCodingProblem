/**
 This problem was asked by Amazon.

 A tree is symmetric if its data and shape remain unchanged when
 it is reflected about the root node. The following tree is an example:

           4
         / | \
       3   5   3
     /           \
   9              9

 Given a k-ary tree, determine whether it is symmetric.
