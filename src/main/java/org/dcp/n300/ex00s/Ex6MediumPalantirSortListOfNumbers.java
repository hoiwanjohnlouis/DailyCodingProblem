/**
 This problem was asked by Palantir.

 You are given a list of N numbers, in which each number is
 located at most k places away from its sorted position.

    For example,
        if k = 1,
        a given element at index 4 might end up at indices 3, 4, or 5.

 Come up with an algorithm that sorts this list in O(N log k) time.
