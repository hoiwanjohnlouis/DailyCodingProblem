 This problem was asked by Google.

 In linear algebra, a Toeplitz matrix is one in which the elements on any given
 diagonal from top left to bottom right are identical.

 Here is an example:

 1 2 3 4 8
 5 1 2 3 4
 4 5 1 2 3
 7 4 5 1 2

 Write a program to determine whether a given input is a Toeplitz matrix.
