/**
 This problem was asked by Google.

 Given a string, return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the string.

 For example, given the following string:

    MAPTPTMTPA

 Return 7, since the longest palindromic subsequence in the string is APTMTPA.
 Recall that a subsequence of a string does not have to be contiguous!

 Your algorithm should run in O(n^2) time and space.
