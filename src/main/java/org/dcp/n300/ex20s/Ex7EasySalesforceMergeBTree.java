 This problem was asked by Salesforce.

 Write a program to merge two binary trees.
 Each node in the new tree should hold a value equal to the sum of the values
 of the corresponding nodes of the input trees.

 If only one input tree has a node in a given position,
 the corresponding node in the new tree should match that input node.
