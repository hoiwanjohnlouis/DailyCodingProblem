/**
 This problem was asked by Coinbase.

 Write a function that takes in a number, string, list, or dictionary and returns its JSON encoding.
 It should also handle nulls.

 For example, given the following input:

    [None, 123, ["a", "b"], {"c":"d"}]

 You should return the following, as a string:

    '[null, 123, ["a", "b"], {"c": "d"}]'
