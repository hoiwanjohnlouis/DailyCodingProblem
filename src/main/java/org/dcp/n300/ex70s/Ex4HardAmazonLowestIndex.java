/**
 This problem was asked by Amazon.

 Given a sorted array arr of distinct integers,
 Return the lowest index i for which arr[i] == i.
 Return null if there is no such index.

 For example, given the array [-5, -3, 2, 3],
 return 2 since arr[2] == 2.
 Even though arr[3] == 3, we return 2 since it's the lowest index.
