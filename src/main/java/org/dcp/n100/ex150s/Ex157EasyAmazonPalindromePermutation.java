 This problem was asked by Amazon.

 Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

 For example, carrace should return true,
 since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome.

 daily should return false,
 since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.
