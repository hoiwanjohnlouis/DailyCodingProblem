/**
 This problem was asked by Bloomberg.

 Determine whether there exists a one-to-one character mapping
 from one string s1 to another s2.

 For example,
 given s1 = abc and s2 = bcd,
 return true since we can map a to b, b to c, and c to d.

 Given s1 = foo and s2 = bar,
 return false since the o cannot map to two characters.
