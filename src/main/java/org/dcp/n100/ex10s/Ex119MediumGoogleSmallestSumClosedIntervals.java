 This problem was asked by Google.

 Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of numbers that covers all the intervals.
 If there are multiple smallest sets, return any of them.

 For example,
 given the intervals [0, 3], [2, 6], [3, 4], [6, 9],
 one set of numbers that covers all these intervals is {3, 6}.
